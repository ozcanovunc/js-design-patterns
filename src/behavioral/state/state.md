Real world example

Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes it's behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will be in blue etc.

In plain words

It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.
